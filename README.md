# biology

## Overview

The biology package is a collection of functions supporting the book
“Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R”. Currently there are no
manual pages in this package - I must do something about that\!\!

## Installation

At this stage, only the development version of this package is
available. The easiest way to install the package is from Github.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pcinereus/biology")
#OR if you get an error about Curl..
devtools::install_github("pcinereus/biology", host="https://api.github.com")
```
